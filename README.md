## More Information
This was built using Next.js since it includes many great features such as...
- Server-side rendering
- Hot reloading out of the box
- and lessens the headache of setting up a React project.

To use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to bootstrap your next project with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
